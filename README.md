# DeepLearning-Recognition-of-Healthy-and-Unhealthy-Retinal-Optic-Disc-Image
Project that recognizes whether the optic disc is healthy or unhealthy by looking at the retina optic disc image

Two different models were used in this project. Sequential and U-net. 90% accuracy rate was obtained from the Sequential model and 80% accuracy rate was obtained from the U-net model.

In this project, the data set was taken from kaggle.com(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/retinal-disease-classification)

In the output example you will see after compiling the project:

1's represent the state of being healthy.  The "true" part is the actual result of the image, and the "pred" part is the predicted result of the image.
